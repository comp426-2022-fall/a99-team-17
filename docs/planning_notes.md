### List of requirements to meet for the project (just so we can keep track!):
The following three script commands should work in your package:
- npm install - Install dependencies for your package.
- npm test - Start app, check that everything can run, and then stop app.
- npm run - Command to bring up all parts of the app/system's server scripts.

Your team is responsible for incorporating the following specifications and deliverables into your final project:
- Back-end specifications
- API built on whatever framework you choose. You can build an API that interacts with other APIs as well in order to integrate them.
- API root endpoint at http://HOST/app/.
- Create (if nonexistent) and interact with a database of users (optional) and interactions (this can be logs, even). If users do not need to login to use   your app, then do not worry about a user DB. These can be separate databases for different microservices or separate tables in one database. It is up to   your team's decisions.
- Database can be of any type you choose.
- Front-end specifications
- Give users the ability to register an account, update their information, see their information somewhere, and delete their account.
- Interactions with the front end should be logged in a database.
- Database specifications
- User database (if relevant) - registration details (username, email address, etc.)
- Interaction database - details of user interactions (login history, access logs, etc.)
- Documentation
- License documenation - Choose a license and include it in the repository just like we have been. (I think I saw that we already had this?) ✅
- README.md file with basic descriptiong, installation requirements/instructions, dependency list, run instructions ✅ (in progress?)
- /docs/ directory containing full documentation of every available API endpoint that you create for your app. This directory should also house an archive     of your planning documentation.
- Code comments (preferably referring to the documentation)
- User instructions in the interface
- Demo video
